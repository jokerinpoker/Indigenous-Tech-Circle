Indigenous Procurement Advantage: Empowering Indigenous Tech in Public and Corporate Contracts

**Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze procurement opportunities for Indigenous-led tech companies and identify unique advantages they can exploit to enhance their competitiveness against larger companies. The project focuses on leveraging public procurement data, data analysis, and visualization techniques to provide actionable insights for Indigenous companies in the tech sector.

**Problem Statement**

Indigenous-led companies often face challenges in securing contracts and scaling their businesses due to:

​	•	Complex procurement processes

​	•	Limited resources and experience in navigating point-based evaluation systems

​	•	Lack of visibility in procurement databases

This project will address these issues by analyzing the procurement landscape and offering insights into how Indigenous businesses can gain an unfair advantage in specific market segments.

**Objectives**

​	•	Analyze the current procurement landscape using public data

​	•	Identify unique opportunities for Indigenous-led companies

​	•	Provide insights to help these companies scale and compete effectively

​	•	Utilize data scraping, visualization, normalization, and possibly machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to automate analysis and extract valuable insights
